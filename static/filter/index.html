                <h1>FAQ</h1>

                <h2>What does FilterCloud offer?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A clean, tasteful and powerful loot filter</li>
                    <li>Customizable style and behaviour</li>
                    <li>Access your loot filter from anywhere</li>
                    <li>Rules based on market value from poe.ninja</li>
                    <li>Detailed leveling rules</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How is this different from Neversink's FilterBlade?</h2>
                <p>Apart from technical features, FilterCloud follows a fundamentally different philosophy.
                    Neversink's filter tries to encode as much information as possible into the color scheme,
                    to ensure that you can make an educated decision to pick an item up or leave it.</p>
                <p>FilterCloud only shows you items that are worth picking up. The idea is that you should not have
                    to think about inventory management while you're killing stuff. If the filter shows it, you pick it
                    up.</p>
                <p>Its color scheme has three main levels of highlighting, plus one special style for super rare
                    items like Mirrors, and optionally a grey style for low-value currency items (in case you don't
                    want to hide them completely). This simplicity makes it super easy to learn what the colors and
                    styles mean.</p>

                <h2>Why are there separate files for Leveling and Endgame?</h2>
                <p>The leveling filter has rather complex rules about what items to show at what level, while the
                    endgame filter has complex rules for maps and rares. Combining both into one file would be
                    problematic for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The rules would become even more complex because they would need to check against the item
                        level in every single rule.</li>
                    <li>The large leveling ruleset might cause performance issues on slower machines when running it
                        against the massive amounts of loot on endgame maps. Especially when it also includes the
                        endgame rules.</li>
                    <li>It would become a lot more error-prone and harder to maintain.</li>
                    <li>There is no strong need for combining them because you don't keep switching between
                        leveling and endgame that often.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="explanation">
                    When mapping, you want to stay in the flow and maintain your clearspeed. You don't want to stop
                    and identify items or even take a trip back to your hideout and sort your inventory. Sure, sometimes
                    you have really lucky drops and it can't be avoided, but most of the time, you want to pick up only
                    those items that have a high probability of being valuable.
                </p>
                <p class="explanation">
                    This filter has two tiers of rares: Highlighted rares are the base types used by currently popular
                    builds very likely to be valuable, or take up very little inventory space like jewelry. You should
                    always pick those up. Non-highlighted rares are still the best of their class, and have a decent
                    chance of being sellable, but you may skip those if you have a high quantity map.

                <p>
                    Low value currency like scrolls, scraps and whetstones are not worth the time picking up.
                    You're better off maintaining a high clearspeed and buying those from other players if needed.
                    It can still make sense to pick them up if a lot of them are close together, like after a Breach
                    or an Artisan's Strongbox.

                <p>
                    In such cases, the filter chooses highlighting based on the most valuable unique with this base type.
                    Some uniques are excluded, e.g. those that can only be obtained via Prophecies or Breachstones,
                    because they can't drop anyway.

                    In endgame, your flask setup should already be optimal. Some flasks may still fetch a good price though,
                    especially with quality. You can configure the minimum quality at which to show certain flasks.

                    Rare Jewels are very likely to be valuable. Magic jewels are usually worthless, unless both affixes
                    are sought after in the current meta and are perfectly rolled. In that case, you may want to regal
                    it and hope for the best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another use for magic jewels is corrupting them and hoping for a good corrupt unique. Unless you
                    specifically go for that though, they're not worth picking up.

                    Once you've reached red maps, you no longer want to pick up white ones. That's why this filter has
                    an option to hide maps that are far below the map tier they drop in. Some yellow maps are valuable
                    and/or worth running even if you're already doing shaped Strands, so you can define exceptions from
                    this rule.
